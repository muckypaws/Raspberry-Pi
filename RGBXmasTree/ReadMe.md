# Play PNG Through Raspberry Pi 3D RGB Christmas Tree

https://thepihut.com/products/3d-rgb-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi

Install the script into a new folder on your Rasberry Pi and simply run the 
PNGCycleTree.py script.

i.e. 

*python3 PNGCycleTree.py*

Currently the program is hardcoded to look for rainbow-cycle.png, however you can modify the script to use a PNG of your choosing, and with some creativity you can create some interesting patterns to display.
